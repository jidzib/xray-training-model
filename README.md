# Multimodal Chest X-ray Classification Training Model Notebook

This notebook trains a multimodal classification training model on chest X-rays. It combines
image-based deep learning with patient tabular features to predict chest conditions.

It is how I generated the model used in my live web-deployed demo: https://xray-webapp.fly.dev 
More information about the model can be found in the README.md for the web app's repository: https://github.com/jidzib/xray-webapp/edit/main/README.md 

### How to use
The model uses CheXpert-v1.0-small from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ashery/chexpert

Download the following files: train.csv, valid.csv, train, valid\
Put them all in the project root alongside the notebook
## NOTE
### This model is for educational and research purposes only, and should not be used for medical
### or clinical diagnosis
